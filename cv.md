## Summary
**My goal:** to get a job as a junior frontend developer in Saint-Petersburg before 2021. 

I studied at the ITMO University on the Computer Technologies cathedra. I have been learning html, css, js for a few months on [linkedin learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/), [freecodecamp](https://freecodecamp.org), [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). Also I participated in some marathons(js, html). It's really important for me to see the result of my work, so that's why I chose frontend development.
